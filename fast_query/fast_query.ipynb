I think most Littleton residents and business owners that want to see the area thrive are excited about this project. Also saw your comment about there not being any jobs up there, but I think you’re forgetting how common remote jobs are nowadays. Sounds like you’re in denial, have you seen the state of the housing/rental market? New Hampshire is growing whether you like it or not, but there will still be plenty of green spaces to go around. Lots of state parks, conservation land, and that big national forest up North will ensure we don’t lose all of our nature. The real threat to our forests is not overdevelopment, but rather invasive species and climate change. But that’s a whole different conversation.', 'WOAH.

They might be rooting for global warming.\", \"No, we literally can't. Carbon capture is joke science; it violates thermodynamics unless you have cold fusion or some similar power source. And climate change is what economists call an *externality*, which is one of the things that capitalism, and the governments that exist to uphold capitalism, are 100% incapable of dealing with. It's a terrible thing to say, but honestly, this civilization's collapse is the best thing possible for the natural world and for the human species. If we survive the coming cataclysm, we're far more likely to do so without it than within it.\", \"We have a pretty limited supply of arable land.  Burning more oil limits arable land even more.  I've got to imaging destroying arable land with climate change  will cause more of an impact to global food prices as the cost of solving the problem of climate change is greater than the savings of using oil.\\n\\nIt would make Canadians living today a shitton of money though which would be cool, but your solution would definitely increase global food insecurity.\", 'I kind of expected it but it’s still disheartening. I’m worried about my kids education and whether or not we’ll have a good health care system when he’s done with it. \\n\\nThen there’s climate change. Doug’s cancelled contracts for wind turbines and eliminated incentives for electric cars… it feel like 5 steps back', 'I once argued with a guy on Reddit who genuinely thought going to Mars was the only plausible answer for the survival of humanity through climate change. \\n\\nMaybe he was a troll, but didn’t seem like it. He truly believed the resources to just fix this planet were far exceeding what would be necessary to transport humans to a terraformed Mars.', 'I liked almost all of Bernie’s talk in 2016 and 2020 except for his climate change talk.

My daughter made the same choice. Broke my heart. But I honor her choice and see it's logic.

While in a closer race they might prefer the coalition to hold government for the economic standpoint, it is unlikely they will be hostile to a Labor government in general. If Labor doesn\\'t get 76 seats, a real possibility, it will have to negotiate more.

SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity are built on billions of dollars in government contracts/ subsidies. The federal government provided most of it but California has showered him with money and provided regulations that favored EVs and solar panels. \\n\\n- some article I read had something along those lines\\n\\nI guess the Republicans that don't believe in green energy nor climate change will be buying Tesla vehicles.\", \"This is what's wrong with the world. People being unproductive to support someone who doesn't know their name or care about them in the slightest. It's sad, really.

Climate change, just take Humanity now.\", \"Probably a major famine caused by wars and climate change. The heat wave in Pakistan and India makes me nervous. Food and water insecurity, rising temps, wars, pandemics, disasters exacerbated by climate change and more. \\n\\nI still choose to be optimistic and believe we will come together and find a way out of this. I also recognize that that optimism isn't really founded on any current evidence. I'm an agnostic, but I guess it's something like hope and faith.\", 'It’s not ‘the west’. It’s just France and Germany.\\n\\nDon’t forget it is also eastern EU members who turn their nose up at renewables and climate change because it’s ‘western SJW propaganda’ but instead thought it was a good idea to keep relying on huge amounts of fossil fuels from Russia.\\n\\nMany in the east have idolised Putin and Russia for a long time. Just look at Hungary.', \"Some things are unavoidably communal. The atmosphere being chief among them. I don't believe in regulating every facet of the economy for climate change.

I think every libertarian would be in support of that.\", \"&gt; Climate change does exist but not at the rate you guys say it is.\\n\\nHow to prove in one sentence you don't have a single clue concerning what you're talking about.\\n\\nThe GIEC, a panel of 400 of the world leading scientists disagree with you. 400 international well respected specialists whose reputation is above any doubt.

It better be solid.\", \"All of these things are connected and won't change unless people are aware and DO something about it though. Climate change affects insects pretty significantly (although that's not the only factor at play), and songbirds mostly eat insects. I understand its abstract and doesn't necessarily grab the imagination, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't talk about it. Hopefully something will click soon.\", \"I support both the cause and this action. Letting down a tyre on a *symbol* of fossil fuel consumption is a low impact way of showing the strength of feeling around climate change.\\n\\nI know some people had their tyres slashed rather than deflated, and this I roll my eyes at. But the tyre can be reinflated. It's non-destructive and an effective way of raising the issue.\", '&gt;\\tThey haven’t made much progress with their challenging.

Here we take a new approach based on probabilistic cost fore-casting methods that made reliable predictions when they were empirically tested on more than 50 technologies. We use these methods to estimate future energy system costs and find that, compared to continuing with a fossil-fuel-based system, a rapid green energy transition will likely result in overall net savings of many trillions of dollars - even without accounting for climate damages or co-benefits of climate policy. We show\\nthat if solar photovoltaics, wind, batteries and hydrogen electrolyzers continue to follow their current exponentially increasing deployment trends for another decade, we achieve a near-net-zero emissions energy system within twenty-five years.

To probe for large-scale patterns in associated phenological change, we use 70,709 observations from six decades of systematic monitoring across the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Among 110 phenological events related to plants, birds, insects, amphibians and fungi, we find a mosaic of change, defying simple predictions of earlier springs, later autumns and stronger changes at higher latitudes and elevations. Site mean temperature emerged as a strong predictor of local phenology, but the magnitude and direction of change varied with trophic level and the relative timing of an event. Beyond temperature-associated variation, we uncover high variation among both sites and years, with some sites being characterized by disproportionately long seasons and others by short ones. Our findings emphasize concerns regarding ecosystem integrity and highlight the difficulty of predicting climate change outcomes.\\n\\n**Source Citation**: Roslin, T., Antão, L., Hällfors, M. *et al.* Phenological shifts of abiotic events, producers and consumers across a continent. *Nat.

The partial contamination means some of the concrete will be buried (not with nuclear waste for most, just buried in a marked ditch is enough as it will not be radioactive for more than a couple decades and not much anyways to be widely dangerous is someone stumble upon it)\\n\\n&gt; It takes 30 years to tear down a nuclear power plant and some 100.000 tons of partially contaminated concrete and steel are coming out of it.\\n\\nIt takes 30 years to tear down a reactor because there is no rush and the longer you wait the easier it becomes as the radioactivity decrease exponentially with time so just wait a bit after the fuel is removed and the contamination will have decrease to levels making the deconstruction much easier and safer for the workers. As I said with the concrete you will have to wait a bit for the radioactivity resulting from its contamination to drop to safe (= you could live your whole life near a piece of it) level so instead of tearing it down and storing this material away until the radioactivity drops, why not just leave it in one piece and tearing it down after?\\n\\nAnd the cost of deconstruction is know, some nuclear reactor have been teared down after waiting a couple decades for the radioactivity to drop to acceptable levels.\\n\\n&gt; Concrete is made of sand which we are also running low of as i heard.\\n\\nConcrete or more precisely the sand used to make it is indeed running low but that's not much concrete when you look at how much is used for construction. It's like saying cigarette lighter burn through our limited fossil fuel reserve when cars exist. But since it's a big problem for the construction industry as a whole research is being made to replace the sand used (like being able to use desert sand instead of which we have more than enough) and since in nuclear reactor most of it is used to build a big concrete pad below the reactor to protect the environment in case of meltdown, it's not like you need high grade concrete like for bridges or skyscrapper. So yeah that's not an issue like the iron needed to build wind turbine is also not really an issue.\\n\\n&gt; How much is this in Solar Cells?\\n\\nThat's why I talked about solar panel without framing, it heavily depends on how you build your solar farm and it will use more or less concrete and steel . Rooftop solar panel require steel for the framing whereas on the ground will also maybe need some concrete if the soil isn't stable enough.\\n\\n&gt; I think the total cost of Nuclear Energy (cradle to cradle) is widely undererstimated.\\n\\nUnlike all other energy sources, we do know the cost of nuclear energy and all its byproducts (i.e. the waste disposal). Most of it firsthand from previous generations of reactor. The fossil fuel industry is priced without the cost of the climate change it causes and the renewable without the cost of its recycling and recycling waste management.\\nFurthermore for nuclear most of the cost is at the beginning and the end, whereas the profit is made in the middle when the reactor is running. We know notice that the reactor stand the test of time much better than the worst case scenario used to plan their lifespan initially (because unlike other energy source with nuclear you always assume the worse case for lifespan as any failure is not an acceptable option) so you can expand their life by a few decades with minimal additional maintenance cost, making them way more profitable than planned. The issue here behind that opponent will use it as an argument and say that the reactor is old and needs to be turned off based on the worst case prediction made 40 years ago instead of the actual status of the reactor that was verified by an independent governmental agency.\\n\\nNuclear is cheap if you assume your reactor will run for 40-60+ years, it is super expensive if they only run 20-30 years. The cost is upfront and because of this if you invest now into new reactor you are committed for half a century otherwise is was a bad investment. But also that's why closing down reactor that could still work safely is a very bad idea, not only for the environment but for the economy as a whole, you already payed the cost to build the reactor and will have to pay the cost of tearing it down anyway at some point, why not use it as much as possible?

Difference feminists are often criticized for overly homogenizing all women's experience and under-representing or outright ignoring the issues, concerns and perspectives of women of color.  Out of difference feminism, we get the most vitriolic of the terfs.

That is why they use computer models, which are proof of absolutely nothing, ever. Computer models are usually used in science to show the phenomenon and study the behaviour of a system in relation to the observed measurements and changing parameters. The connection between CO2 and temperature on earth is at best vague, and no significant signal can be seen in any analysis. There is no definite proof of feedbacks, in fact, in a chaotic system such as our climate, the feedbacks used in the models (basically, the effect of CO2 is mostly based on feedbacks to water vapour) are impossible as they would lead to a hot house earth in a very short period of time, which hasn't happened in the billions of years it has existed. The temperature on earth correlates very well with the moisture content of the lower atmosphere, though. And the current AGW theory relies on dismissing other energy transfer methods, i.e. convection, etc. which are much more significant. For example, vast majority of the energy absorbed by CO2 is transferred away in a collision with nearby molecules. In short, there is so little we can accurately assess and we don't understand the whole system (climate) but for the basics: sun and water (oceans, clouds) control it and there are a lot of other variables, of which CO2 is one and it its effect is impossible to accurately assess for now.\\n\\nConsidering that the anthropogenic climate change is not even a proper theory but a vaguely envisioned possible interlink between CO2 (and its role as an IR absorber) and temperature on earth, and then considering the huge effect of the climate change movement and how it is led, 99% of it is politics.

He built a broad coalition of supporters to back his programs by reaching into typically, at that time on unassociated groups.\\n\\nHis ability to broker compromise between groups allowed them to work in unison. In short, just simply yelling, \"we need to get this done\" isn\\'t going to be bringing groups together.\\n\\nYes, medicine for all is important. Yes, addressing climate change is important. Yes, social equality is important. But in each of those points there are underlying fear that the opposition plays on. And we have yet to have a politician who can articulate an argument to assuage those fears. For the most part the argument has been, \"isn\\'t it obvious why we need that?\"\\n\\nMedicine for all is a slippery slope. Without a profit motive what is there to drive innovation further in medicine? Our government is one who has clearly shown a lack of reinvestment in programs, especially infrastructure. How do we ensure that socialized medicine does not fall into the same trap? Our opposition isn\\'t asking the question of how do we make our medical system better, they are indicating to their followers how do we prevent our medicine from getting worse?\\n\\nWith climate change yes, there is a clear need for that. but with that change there is a gargantuan economic challenge that is before us. We have developed an economy that runs on fossil fuels. If we still switch to a different economy, how do we ensure that, that economy is not worse than the one that we currently have? We can build solar farms and windmills all day long. But that does not address the economical impact that will have on investment into those things and return on gains from those things. It isn\\'t worth pursuing something if it leaves our economy bankrupt. And maybe it might not leave us bankrupt, but if you don\\'t address that, an opponent sure will.\\n\\nThe opposition has an incredibly good tool on their side and that tool is namely fear. And the vast majority of democratic and progressive candidates simply shrug off that fear as unwarranted. All of that does is simply push those who are indecisive and fearful, further into the realm of the opposition. It is no wonder why FDR tackled head on fear of the unknown repercussions of his programs. so when you have Clinton sitting up there shrugging her shoulders about some email server that just feeds the opposition. when you have Sanders up there saying we\\'ll figure out how to fund it later that just feeds the opposition.\\n\\nI am in no way sitting here trying to advocate some slow meticulous process. What I am saying is that if a candidate is not being eloquent enough to address the concerns that are coming up and just simply shrugs it off, that\\'s going to be a surefire way to not win support.\\n\\nYou want a green New deal? How are you going to find it what does it entail, go through the particulars of what that program requires and where the funding comes from. You want socialized medicine? What model are we going to use? How is it going to be funded? How do we continue innovation in medicine? What are the particulars for transitioning from our current system into that?\\n\\nNancy Pelosi sank Obamacare when she got up there and said in front of a bazillion cameras, \"We\\'ll know what\\'s in the bill once it passes.\" That\\'s not an untrue statement, it\\'s just said in a really crappy way.

Furthermore, half life, by definition, means only half would be gone after 27 years) \\n\\nIt's still orders of magnitude longer lasting than anything water vapour could impact.\\n\\n&gt;and it's insulative property is driven by the impact of the sun.\\n\\nNo, insulative properties are a physical property of carbon dioxide gas. It is not conditional on the sun. Carbon dioxide would have insulative properties in a dark room underground, so long as it had IR to absorb.\\n\\n&gt;We have seen a significant increase in CO2 concentrations since records began in 1959 and have seen zero detrimental impacts.\\n\\nAbsence of evidence is not evidence of absence. \\n\\nWe know that CO2 does have insulative properties, we dont have a firm model for how those properties will manifest in the atmosphere.\\n\\nIf you can produce a model that says 'it really won't do anything until concentrations reach x%. Here is exactly why it will do nothing until then. Here is how the atmosphere counters the insulative properties of CO2. Here is how much CO2 we can safely emit with literally no effect on the climate' then you would have a great argument.\\n\\nSuch a model does not exist.\\n\\nThis is why policy makers the world over are erring on the side of caution, because no side can definitively say 'this much CO2 will have this effect'\", \"Seriously, you too?

I primarily use two different LEMs, FastScape and [CHILD](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:CHILD). At their core, these models are solving for the time evolution of topography given various input parameters relating to climate, the properties of the rocks in the landscape, and rates of uplift. They also keep track of the volumes of sediment eroded and deposited. At their core, these types of models are basically just tracking the conservation of mass in an eroding system. There are lots of knobs to twist, especially in CHILD. One of the main things you can control is the way in which fluvial erosion is actually modeled. In simple terms, there are basically three modes, detachment limited, transport limited and a mixed mode between those. In detachment limited systems (which is the numerically the most simple to calculate, and thus the easiest to model), there is always enough capacity of a river to carry the sediment that is eroded from a landscape, so the erosion rate is limited by the rate at which material is \"detached\" from the bedrock. Transport limited systems are instead limited by the capacity of water, i.e. there is always more material detached and produced in situ in a landscape than there is water to move said sediment. The in between (which is the hardest to calculate, so models using this mode take a long time to run) has both happening in different parts of the landscape at different time depending on what is happening upstream of a particular point and what is happening at that point as well. The mixed mode is probably the closest to reality, but because it\\'s so computationally intensive, not a lot of models are done in this mode.\\n\\nThere are so many other knobs to tweak (if you\\'re really interested, just download the user guide for CHILD and start looking through all the different variables you change the values of).

Based on his example 0.2% BC tax increase, for the homes over $3 mil, we'd be looking at taking in between $600k, maybe a million if we're generous with our valuations. No mention of the number of homes over $2 mil.\\n\\nThough he brings up social housing and homelessness several times, No earmarking of these funds specifically for these problems: paying them lip service and dumping the new money into General Revenue seems good enough for him.\\n\\nIf you're going to tell me to support something, don't just throw around words like homelessness, inequality, and climate change and expect people to bite. Explain your plan, or in Janz' case, actually have one to begin with.\", 'If a person doesn\\'t actually want to live within the weather of an area by \"needing\" to create micro-climates inside buildings and vehicles, perhaps stick to the land near and outside of areas with forests (naturally hospitable), and if that temperate area gets over-populated, stop over-breeding, or just deal with what\\'s natural in less-desirable areas? Seems this would do good for multiple issues. Not that I\\'d suggest we cut down forests to make room for humans, but there\\'s plenty of unused land around, North of the 40th parallel, for those that demand living in 65-75 degree rooms.\\n\\nBut people are greedy and varying amount of narcissistic, so this will never happen.\\n\\nIt is indeed difficult to put the cat back into the bag at this point. My point is simple though - a large amount of people claim they love an area, when in fact they refuse to live within its climate. They are just trying to change something to fit their lifestyle, well beyond survival, when it should be adaptation the other way around.\\n\\nIt\\'s not much different than people not liking the politics in an area they move to, or trying to change established politics and beliefs. People always want to change things to fit their view, rather than moving someplace that better fits their own beliefs. Just people trying to be controlling. I won\\'t move to a blue area and try to turn it red, or move to a red area and try to turn it blue. I also won\\'t move to a desert and then complain about water and heat.', \"Exactly, you can't actually answer my question ... all you can do is repeat your conclusion. I guess I just missed the Democrats passing a tax cut for the rich in the middle of a hot economy. Silly me. I guess I missed Democrats arguing that Climate Change and COVID are a hoax ... what was I thinking? I guess I missed the Republicans expanding healthcare access to 30 million Americans ... I must have been napping. Thank God the Democrats are banning Muslims, breaking up families at the border, and stripping away a woman's right to bodily autonomy ... how did they slip that past me!? \\n\\nAre you capable of being honest or arguing in good faith? If so, answer the question I asked you ... what issues do you use to decide whether someone is liberal or conservative? And, on those issues, which position is the liberal position in your book?\", \"There are many aspects to Indianapolis' pothole problem. There is no singular cause\\n\\n* Our climate leads to many freeze-thaw cycles, which obliterate roads.\\n* Marion County's population density is not high enough to generate property taxes such that all of the roads can be maintained. This is a problem in much of the US, but is made worse in Indianapolis, which has a stronger NIMBY population that prevents dense development than most of its peers. There is also the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Board, which does do some important work, but also makes unreasonable rulings about dense proposals such as to prevent dense development.\\n* Indiana has a property tax cap, so there is only so much Marion County can do as far as increasing property taxes to pay for road maintenance.\\n* Indianapolis is home to many nonprofit and government entities - many of which provide services for the entire state and beyond - and because of their status as nonprofits or government entities, they don't pay property taxes. Many of these entities own a lot of valuable land. Think the Indiana Statehouse, IUPUI, IU Health, Crown Hill Cemetery, all of the museums, all of the churches, the state fair grounds, federal government buildings, etc. And far as I know, Indiana has no mechanism to compensate Indianapolis for its lost tax revenue from The State's nontaxable land holdings. (Some states, like Wisconsin, do.)\\n* Indiana's formula for giving counties and municipalities road funding only takes into account linear road miles. For example, a 20-mile-long two lane road in Jasper, Indiana would get more funding from The State than Keystone Avenue in Indianapolis, which is shorter than 20 miles but, because of its width, requires much more maintenance money\\n* When rebuilding roads, both Indiana and Marion County tend to pick shitty contractors that use shitty concrete and asphalt mixes that are not durable.\\n* Indianapolis fixes potholes using inappropriate and/or stopgap methods. This might be a function is lack of money.\\n\\nSo what can we do about it?\\n\\n* Vote for state senators, state representatives, and city councilmen/councilwomen who push for transit and pedestrian infrastructure. Strong transit and pedestrian infrastructure lead to dense development (cars take up too much space), lower our dependency on cars, and build up the tax base such that roads can be properly maintained.\\n* Vote for state senators, state representatives, and city councilmen/councilwomen who seek to make The State fairly compensate Indianapolis for its land holdings in the city.\\n* Vote for state senators, state representatives, and city councilmen/councilwomen who realize that The State's road funding formula is not fair to Indiana's urban communities and set out to change it.\\n*Push Indianapolis' non-profit landowners to maximize their property. For example, Indiana University owns a ton of valuable land Downtown (IUPUI + IUSM), but they don't advertise the fact that they do the vast majority of their research in Indianapolis as to protect the reputation of Bloomington. But if IU beat its chest about Indianapolis as a research hub - which it is - Indianapolis would be in a better position to attract large companies the way Columbus attracted Intel.\\n\\nTL;DR: There are a lot of reasons why our roads are shit, please remember to vote, and we need to make sure that we hold our nonprofits to a high standard.\", 'He\\'s pretty open about wanting to cling to the status quo. It\\'s also a huge part of him telling people that if they have ANYTHING wrong going on in their lives, they are not in a position to try and change the world beyond themselves for the better, i.e. \"no point in worrying about climate change higher minimum wage or union protections unless you have no debt or personal things about yourself to work on.\" So in other words only wealthy well established people who have no desire to change the status quo should be allowed to have a say in changing the status quo.', \"There is none. \\n\\nNot one fucking person besides me did the math and the government hasn't told you shit yet. I'm not mad, its hilariously sad. \\n\\nEV replacements are a pipe dream.\\n\\n\\nI did the math, I'll do it again if you want the numbers. \\n\\nFirst climate change, it cost more carbon to produce a EV than a ICE. We need to replace 200+ million cars in just AMERICA, not including trucks etc. \\n\\nThats carbon production before the *carbon savings*\\n\\nNext, max manufacturing by all American auto plants, im talking full steam ahead, will take 30+ years to replace. \\n\\nDon't get me started on the WORLD lol. You can't handle that number. No one can handle that number.\\n\\nSo if we *build* everyone a ev, we will miss out climate change marks in 2050 because we increased production of a bigger contribution to green house games and THEN we still have 30 years of ICE engines putting out carbon.\\n\\n\\nThey don't tell you this. I have the math. The manufacturers would need ot build up to 5 new plants in total to cut it down to 15 years and thats 5-10 years to BUILD a factory.\\n\\nGet a ebike , emoped  or even a nice Honda trail 125. \\n\\nThats the only way.

Assuming 50% expenses, that's an 11% cap rate. With leverage, that's like a 30% cash on cash return? And I know that may be a little high for the current climate but its not unachievably-crazy-high. These are all just deals on the MLS.\\n\\nSo I know why you would invest in real estate from a FIRE perspective, and I know just how much real estate can beat the 4% rule, I just don't understand why you would go through the hassle of real estate for a 5.5% cash on cash return if you're looking to FIRE. You're at a real risk of underperforming the 4% rule, like /u/ flowercatz is, if you're that close. \\n\\nSurely you could change your strategy or market up a little bit to blow the 4% rule out of the water? Double digit cash on cash returns are not that hard to achieve with 7 figure portfolios. Are you trying to bank on appreciation? Or do you feel constrained to your local market?\", \"Well, human civilisation will probably survive, if in an extremely shittier variant. With a lot less people... and a lot more pain and suffering, so something I'd rather not experience, or have my children/childrens children experience.\\n\\nBut the way I see it is that space exploration will lead to knowledge that will be surpremly helpful in mitigating climate change, as well as give us further knowledge.

There are also a lot of Christian countries in Africa where that applies. It's an Authoritarian opinion because it's against someone doing something they want but at the same time, it's to protect other people's freedom.

With climate change, it hits their corporate allies in their pockets. With LGBTQ+ issues, it alienates their social conservative base. Regardless, most conservative Canadians aren't against these things. Rejecting climate change is...mostly a business tactic for them. Energy companies are important here and they don't want to alienate them. But they also refuse to submit to them. Even in Alberta - our most conservative province - Albertans will resist things like extraction or pipeline projects if they don't make sense. Their Premier tried to get a pipeline to the US going, but people weren't having it.\\n\\nUltimately, politics is a game of chess. Few conservatives here think they can dominate the national philosophy of our nation, largely in part due to the fact that we're a parliamentary constitutional nation. Our politics aren't as black and white, so parties can only do so much before they piss off everyone. They do certain things like deny climate change, but they won't push it too far because it'll hurt them in the polls. And thankfully, a lot of it is infighting. O'Toole - the head of the Conservatives - is not a popular guy and doesn't have much support from his own party. So they feel like they can score a win by doing stuff like that. But if they tried to make that a national policy? It wouldn't work. Canadians would be livid, since we're not dumb or passive.

Our government’s priority should always be in the best interest of the people. Even though the governor might not agree with the ways the federal government might want to alleviate this issue, he should compromise as well as possible in order to fix these issues. I believe the federal government should take most of the responsibility for making changes to alleviate issues like this in the future because they have more resources to make changes and because this is not an issue that just pertains to California. Climate change is a worldwide issue that should be addressed by our world leaders promptly. I think climate change should be addressed in a collaborative effort between governments across the globe if it is going to be reversed before it is too late. I think these fires are a result of climate change, so it is definitely the federal government’s responsibility to take action in this situation. Whether they own the land or not, when people are dying, the federal government should interfere.', \"Excellent reply, I've got reading to do when I'm not on the clock.

If the superpowers are struggling to tackle climate change together, it's not hard to imagine certain factions stoking the flames for national or personal gain. As long as a calculated sacrifice for the motherland is doing more harm to their adversaries, I wouldn't put it past a country like Russia.\", 'I ponder this often too. I\\'m not sure how it will change. I think it will change but the mass public won\\'t notice the change. They\\'ll just blindly bump up against the constraints you are talking about. But they won\\'t fight it. They\\'ll go along. Maybe they have to. \\n\\nI wonder about it all from a technology point of view. How here in the \"systems age\", where everything is viewed as a system, i wonder if corporatism is just a new form of organizational technology, system technology, that is required to scale the population to a higher level in a confined \"1 planet only\" living space. \\n\\nThere\\'s this moment in Matrix 2, dumb I know, but hear me out, where the leader of Zion is showing Neo the machines that clean the water and provide resources in Zion. And he asks what\\'s the difference between those machines and the ones they were fighting. Neo answers Control. \\n\\nDeep down, I understand the scaling of technology coming from an IT background. I have seen the results of running a system with no changes too long. There are certain technology combinations that work well when you only have 100 employees, but then you grow to over 1000 and things start to break down and cause systemic problems bordering on business failure. Space and cost are constraint variables that also determine the system. They are often the upper limits that force systematic change. We\\'ve run out of space to increase production and competitors haven\\'t. Or we\\'ll go broke if we continue down this path. \\n\\nAnd this is how I view the climate change issue. Coal technology worked fine when the world was under 4 billion people (world population when I was born in \\'71). But now as we are scaling towards 20+ billion (the end of my lifetime), 20 billion people that will all want cars, planes, internet, and electricity.... the current tech just isn\\'t going to scale. We\\'re gonna hit those upper constraint limits of unwanted byproducts. Meanwhile, the finance market has at least figured it out that per Kwh, the new \\'green\\' tech is more profitable because while fossil fuels are hard to get to and expensive to refine, with the new tech, the sun shines everywhere, the wind blows everywhere, and water flows down hill everywhere.\\n\\nI feel that capitalism has a dirty little secret. That under the hood they are using socialist (socialist not socialism) principles inside their organizations to grow their systems and eventually dominate systems outside their organization. At their core, Corporations already have to redistribute their wealth to the shareholders or they risk a different kind of system collapse. Those shareholders didn\\'t contribute to that profit, but they are definitely entitled to it per their investment ownership. So to avoid system collapse of their internal corporate system, they\\'ll give away some of their wealth to influence and control other systems. Like in this photo, we have evidence that Kingdom Pepsi not only wants to bandwagon on to the good feelings and relief that comes from testing and associate it with their product, they want to also help make sure their system of customers don\\'t collapse. So of course when Kingdom Walmart called and said, Hey let\\'s pay for a sign and throw a lot of money towards this to make sure it succeeds, they both did because they aren\\'t stupid. I wonder, if big giant corporate systems that actively manipulate the dumb herd of people towards system success didn\\'t exist, would the system collapse? If it was truly a regulated market where smaller businesses thrived instead of the these mega ones, would the system collapse? \\n\\nI mean if we are going to squeeze 20 billion people into a zoo that was only designed to hold 4 billion people, we are going to have to create over-arching world wide organizational technology that reinforces systems that feed, water, and house all those people, right? Since, governmentally people are too stubborn and prideful to compromise to scale the system, it\\'s going to happen in the private sector one way or another, right? In fact, like the matrix, the corporatists have discovered through endless blind taste tests and focus groups, that if you don\\'t create this unfair game system where there are winners and losers, it won\\'t work. If you don\\'t \\'take over\\' and force a system of organization upon this easily manipulated herd, it\\'ll violently collapse into a smaller self-managing pattern. \\n\\nThis is how groups like the illuminati get started, isn\\'t it. lol', \"Uh no?

Humanity is still struggling with the problems of overpopulation, ecological destruction of the environment, economic inequalities, wrong monetary system, lack of appropriate nutrition for all people, and local minor wars. People are living in this hastily race for atomic financial survival without time to look for their inner self and spiritual development.\\n\\nIn 2204 A.D. is completed a large colonization of the planet Mars, of 20 million people. But in 2265 A.D. a vast natural destruction kills them all. Never again humanity tries to colonize Mars.\\n\\n2309 A.D. As the result of accumulated and non-solved problems, another big disaster comes to earth and is the great global war. A great part of the civilization as we know it stops to exist. The destruction hits as an almost extinction mainly of the yellow and black races.\\n\\n2396 A.D. This great change leads to the final establishment of a Global Parliament on Earth of the Global Union of Nations or States. But this Global Parliament, although it is elected through voting by the nations, is not from politicians or businessmen, but from scientists, technologist, and humanitarian figures. The money as we know it does not exist anymore. The planetary resources are redistributed and are now enough for every person. The overpopulation, the climate, the nutrition, and the ecological problems are solved.\\n\\nBut not entirely the subtle tyranny problem. Life is easy, and people work less and less during their life. The years start counting again with year number 1, the 2396 (as in the time of Jesus Christ). Nevertheless, the Global Government is a form of totalitarianism, and national governments oppose it directly or indirectly for a couple more centuries. People are still with national consciousness and have not developed the planetary consciousness.\\n\\nOnly after 2-5 centuries finally, they did. Although there are not economic inequalities as we knew them, there are still inequalities over control of the level of technology and properties. People are spiritually weak and sluggish. This “peculiar Dark Age era” lasts till 3400.\\n\\n3382 A.D. A remarkable phenomenon happens in humanity. People one after the other acquire suddenly a new spiritual ability that could be called hyper-vision or hyper-intuition. A direct access to “the great Spiritual Light” or “Direct Knowledge” with extremely powerful and of stunning clarity creative powers. It is also a mutation of the human brain.\\n\\n3400-4000 A.D. A new “Golden Age” comes in humanity after almost 1,000 years of “dark age”. Now in the Global Government are not any more scientists and technocrats. There the “Universal Creators”. Personalities that combine simultaneously the qualities and abilities of philosopher, artist, scientist, adept, mystic, etc. Everything in the society is free, clothes, house, food, transportation, etc. There is no private property, and the only inequalities are of honor and reputation.\\n\\nPeople do not count anymore the success of their lives with the technological and material standards of living, but mainly with their emotional, mental and spiritual development and self-improvement. People work only 2 years in their whole life, between the equivalent of 17 and 19 years. The population of earth is less than a billion people, and there is an abundance of products for a decent living. The laws in the society are radically reduced to very few only, as the negative or criminal intentions of individuals in the society are almost absent.\\n\\nThere are only three kinds of laws:\\n\\n1) Those referring to the 2-year term of working.\\n\\n2) Those referring to how traveling traffic and distribution of goods is done.\\n\\n3) Those referring to the demographic stable size population (control of births)', 'Alternative facts right from the horse\\'s mouth:\\n\\nQuote by Chris Folland of UK Meteorological Office: “The data don\\'t matter.

All we have done is take the balance of the ice on Antarctica and found that it is melting — there is no doubt. But with the rapidly accelerating rates at which the ice is melting, and **in the light of all the other, well-publicized lines of evidence, most scientists would be hard pressed to find mechanisms that do not include human-made climate change.**”\\n\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nSo, it's blatantly clear what the researchers believe to be causing the melting. \\n\\nThe article I linked in the OP pointed out the rather curious failure to mention [that](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/01/20/world/21volcano.largegraphic.jpg):\\n\\n[Scientists Find Active Volcano in Antarctica](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/world/21volcano.html) \\n\\n&gt;In an article published Sunday on the Web site of the journal Nature Geoscience, Hugh F. J. Corr and David G. Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey report the identification of a layer of volcanic ash and glass shards frozen within an ice sheet in western Antarctica.\\n\\n&gt;For Antarctica, “This is the first time we have seen a volcano beneath the ice sheet punch a hole through the ice sheet,” Dr. Vaughan said.\\n\\n&gt;Heat from a volcano could still be melting ice and contributing to the thinning and speeding up of the Pine Island Glacier, which passes nearby, but Dr. Vaughan doubted that it could be affecting other glaciers in West Antarctica, which have also thinned in recent years. Most glaciologists, including Dr. Vaughan, say that warmer ocean water is the primary cause.\\n\\nSo, I find the researchers somewhat disingenuous or just too willing to rush to a conclusion, take your pick.\", \"&gt;“We’ve estimated how much carbon dioxide would be required to get this steamy atmosphere, and the answer is about 30,000 ppm of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is actually good news in terms of anthropogenic climate change,” Goldblatt says. Thirty thousand ppm is about 10 times more carbon dioxide than most experts estimate could be released from burning all available fossil fuels\\n\\nThat's my point. And the counterpoint studies are even less favorable:\\n\\n&gt;Not everyone is convinced Goldblatt’s result is valid, however. James Kasting, a geoscientist at The Pennsylvania State University, suspects that even in theory an anthropogenic runaway remains out of reach of humanity. Kasting performed many of the earlier seminal studies that seemed to rule out a present-day runaway, and with his student Ramses Ramirez is currently polishing a new study that reinforces those conclusions. No matter how much carbon dioxide is pumped into the present-day Earth’s atmosphere in Kasting’s models, the resulting heating is insufficient to cause the planet to rapidly boil off its oceans. “The bottom line,” Kasting says, “is that we do not get a runaway.”\\n\\n-----------------------\\n\\n&gt;Outside of better models, other useful constraints on the runaway greenhouse scenario come from the Earth’s long history. Measurements of 56-million-year-old sedimentary rocks have revealed an event during the mid-Cenozoic era called the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) in which a millennia-scale pulse of greenhouse gases warmed the globe. The PETM pulse seems to have been roughly equivalent to what humans could release through burning all recoverable fossil fuels, and may have warmed the planet in excess of 10 degrees Celsius, but clearly no catastrophic runaway occurred, for otherwise we would not now be here. If it didn’t happen then, many researchers suggest, it won’t happen now from a similar, anthropogenic spike of greenhouse gas.\\n\\nClimate change is a very serious problem, but an unfounded exaggeration of the issue just plays into the hands of the people that want to dismiss all concern as coming from crazy alarmists.\", 'Haha science worshipper, you are funny.

Vegans point out, that going into the supermarket and having an abundant choice of everything now a days, makes it easier to choose the product with the least impact, which mostly excludes animal products.\", 'While normally I would use this as evidence for not having kids, I recently read that it’s corporations and capitalists that want people to believe that overpopulation is causing climate change, when it is actually them and poor distribution and management of resources. They don’t want informed people having kids because they would be more difficult to control as consumers. It reminds me of Idiocracy. As 26F, I’m back and forth about having kids, but I am confident in my ability to raise a well-rounded child that cares for the environment and their communities. All of this causes a lot of inner turmoil for me.', ' [Linkedin article published by Herbert Diess (CEO of VW) on 28 Nov](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-transform-volkswagen-herbert-diess?trk=public_profile_article_view) \\n\\nhere are some quotes that mentioned Tesla :\\n\\n\" Our climate targets are now more ambitious, which is speeding up the transformation process. New competitors with IT business-like capabilities, such as **Tesla**, are pacing the change and ***setting new standards***.\"\\n\\n\" As a result, we had to tailor Volkswagen’s strategy to keep up with these new competitors. To this end, we organized a second workshop with Professor Malik in April 2020. 31 senior executives from Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche were involved in ‘Mission T’, as it was dubbed. The event revolved around ***how we can catch up with Tesla*** – a company focused exclusively on the future, without a traditional car business.\"\\n\\n\" The opening question was: “***What do we have to achieve in the next six months to catch up with Tesla in terms of technology by 2024***?”\"', \"Every parent I know talks about our fears for our kids (including climate change and wealth inequality). But that doesn't mean we regret having kids; many of us are driven to action by our concerns so we can leave the world a better place for them.\", \"AOC gets way too much hate on this sub. She's not perfect but progress requires both the people shouting for change and the people who sit down and write realistic legislation. She's brought a lot of attention to climate change and has motivated young people to get politically engaged. I admire her a lot for that.\", 'What was the most down to earth moment for Trump? Was it when he wasted his two minutes to speak directly to American families and spent it criticizing Obama and Biden and then Joe spent his two minutes to speak directly to us like a human being?\\n\\nI gotta admit though, lots of people think Donny slaid it when Biden was talking about the 500+ immigrant children they separated from their parents that we\\'re still unable to reunite with their parents and interrupted him with, \"good\" \\n\\nOr maybe you think he clinched it with the two minutes to address climate change he spent frothing at the mouth about sewage in China and India? Hang on, it was the part where Biden gave a cogent answer and plan and Donny retorted with, \\'How will you make China agree? \" and Biden answered he\\'d start by rejoining the Paris accord and holding them to their word?\\n\\nYeah man, he killed it. Super down to earth, totally empathetic.', \"[Joe Biden says he believes in climate change, but he wont ban fracking. Sounds like he's a liar, much like yourself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79q2L5d52ag&amp;t)\", \"Society is exactly what is destroying the planet. End society and we won't have to worry about climate change and ecological destruction. \\n\\nDon't need cars to live as we saw during alert level 4, but all people care about is jobs and growth.\", \"Why should capitalism wait for 3 trees to grow when it can cut 3 more trees in the forest for more profit now, out-competing its competition? How would you otherwise explain all the exploitation of nature going on at the cost of any future?\\n\\nAnd what if the profitability of solar and clean energy is too low compared to oil for too long (like it is currently)? I mean, hell, the big oil companies knew about climate change and the disasters it would bring in the 80s. So what did they do? They buried that knowledge away and funded climate change denial propaganda so they could keep selling oil.\\n\\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/ \\n\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings\\n\\nProfit doesn't lie in saving the climate, profit lies in exploiting everything as much as possible as fast as possible. And if you do not do this, someone else will come and do it, out-competing you.\\n\\nAnother historical example of this are tobacco companies. Together with countless other examples where incentives and profitability wins over any semblance of ethics.\", 'Climate change is kind of like talking about raising taxes to balance the budget.  Evryone know we have to do it but no one wants to hear it.  Just look at what happened to Walter Mondale.\\n\\nI think it is better to do an end run around the subject and talk about sustainability, opportunity and self sufficiency.']\n"
